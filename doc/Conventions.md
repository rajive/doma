## Naming Conventions

- Participant Libraries end with `_Library`
- Participant base name are derived from participant names by prefixing
  `BASE_NAME`, thus: `$(BASE_NAME_<name_of_participant>)`
- QoS Libraries end with `QoSLib`, for consistency with the builtin
  qos profiles naming conventions `BuiltinQosLibExp`
- User defined QoS profile names start with `User.`
- Selected or preferred user QoS profile names start with `User.Selected.`

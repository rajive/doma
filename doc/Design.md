## Interface Definition

A data-oriented interface is defined by:

- an *abstract* participant whose name is the interface name

- inputs: 
  - Subscriber(s) containing DataReaders
  - Subscribers are associated with SubscriberQos
  - DataReader(s) are associated with DataReaderQos

- outputs: 
  - Publishers(s) containing DataWriters
  - Publishers are associated with PublisherQos
  - DataWriters(s) are associated with DataWriterQos  


An abstract participant

- can be be composed with other abstract participants (interfaces)
- does *not* specify a participant_qos 

Abstract participants are composed via inheritance

-  `base_name=$(BASE_NAME_...)`Â 
- `BASE_NAME__...` environment variable specifies the base interface


## Service Definition

A service is a collection of interfaces. At a minimum a service definition 
includes:

- a service name, say `MyService`

- OPTIONAL: a `<types>` tag 
   - typically using `<include file="...">` tags to load the XML type definitions
     (generated from IDL), that are used by the service 
   - only needed if dynamic types are used by the service
   - NOTE: it is a good practice to include this section, so that the service
     definition works with both compiled types and dynamic types

- a `domain_participant_library` named `name=MyService_Library` that contains:

  - a marker interface (i.e. has no inputs and outputs) named `MyService_Root` that 
    - OPTIONAL: `<register_type>` tags
      - registers the types used by the service; this is only needed
        if dynamic types are used (e.g. using scripting in Lua etc.)
      - NOTE: it is a good practice to register the types, so that the service
   	  definition works with both compiled types and dynamic types
    - `<topic>` tags for each topic used by the service
    
  - one or more service interfaces  

- a `qos_profile` named `ServiceQoSLib::User.Service.MyService` that defines the 
  endpoint qos policies for all the topics used by the service 
  using topics filters (`topic_filter`)


## Components

A component is an instantiation of a (composite) of service interfaces. 
It is a unit of deployment.  Its implementation is built into the framework. 
Typically, there will be one component per unix-style 'process`.

A component is configured by defining the environment variables:

- `NAME_Component`     = "component name"
- `DOMAIN_ID_Component` = "domain id"
- `BASE_NAME_Component` = "the *composite* interface to instantiate"


A component's DomainParticipantFactoryQos and DomainParticipantQos
are retrieved from the qos profile 
 `ComponentQoSLib::User.Selected.Component.$(NAME_Component)` 

This qos profile may customize qos policies for:

- `participant_qos`
- `participant_factory_qos`
